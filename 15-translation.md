# Explore Azure AI Translator

> **Note**
> To complete this lab, you will need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free?azure-portal=true) in which you have administrative access.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help simplify translation between languages, helping to remove barriers to communication across countries and cultures.

To test the capabilities of Azure AI Translator service, we'll take a look at it in action in the Azure Portal. The same principles and functionality apply in real-world solutions, such as web sites or phone apps.

## Create a *Translator* resource

You can use the Translator service by creating either a **Translator** resource or an **Azure AI services** resource.

For this exercise, create an **Translator** resource in your Azure subscription.

1. In another browser tab, open the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true), signing in with your Microsoft account.

1. Click the **&#65291;Create a resource** button and search for *Translator*. Select **create**. You will be taken to a page to create a Translator resource. Configure it with the following settings:
    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*.
    - **Resource group**: *Select or create a resource group with a unique name*.
    - **Region**: *Choose any available region*.
    - **Name**: *Enter a unique name*.
    - **Pricing tier**: Standard S0

1. Review and create the resource, and wait for deployment to complete. Then go to the deployed resource.

## Explore Translator service 

We can explore the capabilities of the Translator service in the Azure Portal. 

1. In the Azure portal, in the deployed resource, review the *Overview* page.

1. In the *Try it* section of the Overview page, under the *From: Auto detect* section, type the text `Welcome to Azure AI Fundamentals`. Notice the JSON that appears in correspondence in the *View request* section. 

1. In the *View response* section, view the JSON. Behind the scenes, a *request* has been sent to the Translator service. The *response* includes the detected source language with a confidence score, a translation using the alphabet of the output language, and an output language code. 

1. The demo in the *Try it* section shows what it would look like if you created a simple translation application with a user interface. In the case of the demo, as soon as you type in text, a request is made to the Translator service. How could you make this request? Check out the *Sample Code* tab. Here you see examples of code in different programming languages that could be used to make the request. 

1. Identify the lines in the code samples where you need to include your Translator service's **Key** and **Endpoint**. With your key and endpoint, you would be able to send a request to the Translator service, and receive a response like you saw in the demo. 

1. Navigate to the left hand menu. Under *Resource Management*, select *Keys and Endpoint*. If you were to build an application, you would find your key and endpoint here. 

## Clean-up

1. Delete your resource once you are done using it.
